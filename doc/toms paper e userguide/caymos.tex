\section{Introduction}


%BACKGROUND: cayley configuration space, 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages, continuous paths, 
%connected components


A key underlying barrier in understanding underconstrained geometric
constraint systems is the classical problem of representing and efficiently finding 
 the \emph{Euclidean realization spaces} of
\emph{1-degree-of-freedom linkages}, or \emph{mechanisms} in 2D.
A {\em linkage} $(G,\bar{l})$, is a graph $G=(V,E)$ with fixed
length bars as edges, i.e. $\bar{l}: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 
A 2D \emph{Euclidean realization} or \emph{configuration} $G(p)$ of $(G,\bar{l})$ is 
an assignment of points $p: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ to the vertices of $G$ satisfying the bar lengths in $\bar{l}$, 
modulo Euclidean motions. 
If the linkage is \emph{flexible} (i.e., the space of realizations of a
linkage is infinite), but the addition of a
single bar causes the linkage to become \emph{minimally rigid} 
(i.e. only finitely many realizations), then the linkage is called a 
\emph{mechanism} with \emph{1-degree-of-freedom (1-dof)}. 
%A well-known example is the 2D mechanism underlying the Strandbeest, 
%shown in Figure \ref{fig:beest}. 




Describing and analyzing realization spaces of 1-dof linkages in 2D is 
a  difficult problem with a long history. 
%In mechanical computer aided design, it represents a key underlying barrier
%to understanding underconstrained geometric constraint system.
In fact, even for rigid linkages, the number of realizations can be exponential in the number of vertices
and not easy to estimate \citep{Borcea2004}. 
%One way to classify realizations is to use \emph{realization types} \cite{bib:navigation,bib:FudHo97},  
%which uniquely determines a realization of a rigid linkage. 
For flexible linkages, 
a well-known early result \citep{Kempe1875} 
shows that an arbitrary algebraic curve can be traced by the motion of a linkage joint. 
One outstanding example is the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage, which transforms planar rotary motion into straight-line motion \citep{Kempe1877}. 
%For polygonal linkages, recent results on the variants of Carpenter's rule problem and pseudotriangulations yield spaces of non-crossing realizations and expansive motions \cite{bib:streinu05,bib:straightening,bib:rote03}.
Versions of the problem play an important role in Computer-Aided-Design (CAD), 
robotics and molecular geometry \citep{Sacks2010,Ying1995,Sitharam2005}, but few results are known beyond individual or specific families of linkages. 

\noindent{\bf Note:} In the remainder of this article the term ``linkage" refers specifically to ``2D linkage". 


In this paper, we restrict ourselves to \emph{1-dof tree-decomposable linkages}.
The underlying graphs $G$ of such linkages 
are obtained by dropping an edge from so-called \emph{tree-decomposable graphs}. 
Tree-decomposable linkages are 
minimally rigid and well-studied, for example, in geometric constraint solving and CAD.
For tree-decomposable linkages, if the bar lengths $\bar{l}$ are in $\mathbb{Q}$, 
the coordinate values of a realization are solutions to 
a triangularized quadratic system with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$
(i.e. the coordinates of the realization belong to an extension field over $\mathbb{Q}$ obtained by nested square-roots). 
Such values are called ruler-and-compass solvable or \emph{quadratically-radically solvable} \emph{(QRS)} values.
%because they are ruler-and-compass realizable or \emph{quadratically-radically solvable} (\emph{QRS}),
%i.e., if the bar lengths $\bar{l}$ are in $\mathbb{Q}$, the realizations are solutions to a
%triangularized quadratic system with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$
%(i.e. the coordinates of the realization belong to an extension field over
%$\mathbb{Q}$ obtained by nested square-roots). % and

\end{figure}

A graph $G$ is \emph{1-dof tree-decomposable} if there exists a non-edge $f$, 
called a \emph{base non-edge} (there could be more than one), 
such that $G$ has the following graph theoretical construction from $f$:
%(see for example Figure \ref{fig:beest}(a)):
at {\emph{Construction Step $k$}}, 
the graph constructed so far, $G_{k-1}$, is extended by
adding two new maximal tree-decomposable subgraphs, or \emph{clusters} $C_{k1}$ and $C_{k2}$ sharing a vertex $v_{k}$. 
In addition, $C_{k1}$ and $C_{k2}$ each has exactly one shared vertex, $u_k$ and $w_k$ respectively, 
with $G_{k-1}$. Such a construction step is denoted $v_k \triangleleft (u_k,w_k)$.
For example, the underlying graph of the linkage in Figure \ref{fig:four_cycle}(b) has three construction steps from the non-edge $f$:
$v_1 \triangleleft (v_0,v_0')$ which appends $\triangle v_0v_1a$ and the edge $(v_0',v_1)$,
$v_2 \triangleleft (v_0,v_0')$ which appends the edge $(v_0,v_2)$ and  $\triangle v_0'v_2b$, 
and $v_3 \triangleleft (a,b)$ which appends two edges $(v_3, a)$ and $(v_3, b)$.
Similarly, the underlying graph of the linkage in Figure \ref{fig:four_cycle}(a) has four construction steps from the non-edge $f$.
On the other hand, the underlying graph of the linkage in Figure \ref{fig:four_cycle}(c) is not 1-dof tree-decomposable, as there does not exist a construction sequence from any non-edge. 

A \emph{realization type} for a 1-dof tree-decomposable linkage 
specifies a \emph{local orientation} for the triple $(v_k,u_k,w_k)$,
for each construction step  $v_k \triangleleft (u_k,w_k)$. 
For example, for the linkage in Figure \ref{fig:four_cycle}(b), 
the construction step $v_3 \triangleleft (a,b)$ has a local orientation such that $a,b,v_3$ lie in counterclockwise order. Another possible orientation, with $a,b,v_3$ in clockwise order, can be obtained by flipping $v_3$ to the other side of $(a,b)$. 
For a given realization type, 
a 1-dof tree-decomposable linkage $(G,\bar{l})$ has a simple ruler and compass realization $G(p)$
which parallels the graph theoretic construction. 
%For example, for the linkage in Figure \ref{fig:beest}(a), the ruler and compass realization step corresponding to Construction Step 1 has two possible local orientations, 
%one is shown in the figure, and the other has $p(v_6)$ located on the other side of $(p(v_0),p(v_3))$. 
%The local orientations for all realization steps constitute the forward realization type. 
On the other hand, when a realization type is not specified, 
determining the existence of a realization is however NP-hard \citep{Sacks2010}. 


We note here that each cluster has finitely many realizations according to its inner realization types. 
As no continuous motion is possible between those realizations, 
in this paper, we assume that the clusters are \emph{globally rigid}, i.e. we fix the inner realization type of each cluster so that each cluster has a single realization. 
We also reduce clusters sharing only two vertices with the rest of the graph into edges. 









\subsection{Problems with the state of the art} \label{sec:soa}

There are numerous existing %examples of algorithms and 
softwares suites dealing with 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages, 
such as Geometry Expressions \citep{todd2007geometry}, SAM \citep{artasengineering2010sam},  Phun \citep{algoryx2013algodoo}, Sketchpad \citep{keycurriculum1995geometer}, Geogebra \citep{geogebrainc2001geogebra}, D-cubed \citep{siemens1999d},  GIM \citep{petuya2014educational}, CUIK \citep{porta2014open}, 
% the algorithm in \cite{Hidalgo2011}, 
etc. 
They have the following major functionalities: 
(\romannumeral 1) designing 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages for tracing out specific curves, 
especially by building new mechanisms based on a library of existing ones;
%Some of them provide a library of well-known mechanisms, so that the user
%can build new mechanisms based on the existing ones. 
%Focus on design linkages, especially based on well-known templates. 
(\romannumeral 2) accepting user-specified parameters, ranges and realization types to generate 
continuous motion of the linkages. 
%and allow user to trace various parameters of the linkage during continuous motion, 
%for example, the length of a base non-edge, the 2D curve traced out by a vertex, etc.

\smallskip
%However, the following issues, while already having some theoretical answers (which we will refer to in the next subsection), still have not been implemented. \\
However, while some theoretical answers have been provided recently for the following issues (which will be described in the next subsection), until now there has been no theoretically guaranteed software implementation that addresses these issues.

\noindent\textbf{(a)} How do we canonically represent and visualize the connected components? 
In the above softwares, 
the realization space is typically represented as separate curves in 2D that are 
traced by each vertex of the linkage. 
In fact, 
a realization actually corresponds to a tuple of points, one on each of these curves.
I.e., the realization space is bijectively represented by a curve in the full %, minimal 
\emph{ambient dimension} of $2|V|-3$ after factoring out rigid transformations, 
where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the linkage. \\
\textbf{(b)} %Generating all connected components: 
%currently, there is no 
How do we generate all connected components  efficiently  and  how do we find a path of continuous motion between two arbitrary input realizations
in the same connected component? 
In order to generate continuous motion in most of the existing software suites except for CUIK,
%Until now, in order to generate continuous motion, 
the user must %fix the portion of the realization space of interest, 
specify a range of a parameter containing the parameter value at the given realization.
% to generate continuous motion. 
Then either a single connected component is generated
for a subset of the specified range, 
or multiple segments of the realization space, under only the given realization type,  
are generated within the specified range. We discuss this issue in more detail in the following subsection. \\
\textbf{(c)} How do we find the ``distance'' between connected components? 
Until now, 
for two realizations in different connected components, 
there is no software that finds how ``close" they can get towards each other by continuous motion, 
%between two realizations in different connected components of the realization space.
using a meaningful definition of ``distance" between connected components. 
%We discuss this issue in more detail at the end of Section \ref{sec:previous_cayley}.
%so continuous motion is generated
%within a fixed connected component of the realization space, 
%or within a fixed realization type.
%In \cite{Hidalgo2011}, an algorithm was developed to find a continuous
%motion path between two realizations for 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages.
%However, this algorithm requires exhaustive searching, and can have exponential time complexity
%even as a function of natural discrete measures of path lengths. \\
%We would like to generate the entire set of complete connected components of a linkage. \\

\subsection{Previous work on Cayley configuration spaces of 1-dof 2D linkages}
\label{sec:previous_cayley}


The recent papers \citeN{Sitharam2011a,Sitharam2011b,sitharam2014beast}
introduced the use of \emph{Cayley configuration space} to describe the 
realization space of a 1-dof, 2D linkage $(G,\bar{l})$.  
A Cayley configuration space is obtained by taking %a pair of vertices whose distance is not fixed by the bars,
%i.e., 
an {\em independent non-edge} $f$ with $G\cup f$ being minimally rigid, 
and asking for all possible lengths that $f$ can attain %\cite{Gao2005,Sitharam2008,Sitharam2011a,Sitharam2011b}
(\romannumeral 1) over all the realizations of $(G, \bar{l})$; 
(\romannumeral 2) over all realizations of $(G, \bar{l})$ of a particular realization type. % from $f$. 
For (\romannumeral 1) (resp. (\romannumeral 2)), each realizable length of $f$ is called a (resp. \emph{oriented}) \emph{Cayley configuration}, 
and the set of all such configurations is called the (resp. \emph{oriented}) \emph{Cayley configuration space} of the linkage $(G,\bar{l})$ on $f$, parametrized by the length of $f$. 
The Cayley configuration space (non-oriented) is a set of disjoint closed intervals on the real line, 
called \emph{non-oriented Cayley intervals}.
%For example, in Figure \ref{fig:ccs} (C), 
%the Cayley configuration space of the linkage on the non-edge $(v_0,v_1)$ is a single interval.
As the Cayley configuration space is the union of all the different oriented Cayley configuration spaces, 
each non-oriented Cayley interval is a union of several \emph{oriented Cayley intervals}. 
For a 1-dof tree-decomposable linkage $(G, \bar{l})$, 
any base non-edge $f$ yielding a construction sequence can be taken as the Cayley non-edge parameter to give a reasonable Cayley configuration space. 
%if any base non-edge $f$ is taken as the Cayley non-edge parameter,
%we have the following desirable properties:
%(1) The linkage $(G\cup f, \bar{l})$ is rigid, so that there exist only finitely many realizations for each (oriented) Cayley configuration $l_f$.



An important complexity measure of the Cayley configuration space 
is its \emph{Cayley complexity}, i.e. the algebraic descriptive complexity of the interval endpoints 
in the Cayley configuration space \cite[Section 1.2]{Sitharam2011a}.  
Specifically, if the endpoints are QRS values, the corresponding linkage is said to have \emph{low Cayley complexity}.
Low Cayley complexity is the minimal requirement on 2D linkages for tractable algebraic descriptive complexity of the configuration space. 
In other words,
for general linkages without low Cayley complexity,
even the algebraic description complexity of a single endpoint of the configuration space is NP-hard \citep{Sitharam2011a}.
We observe that  many commonly studied mechanisms, including the Cardioid linkage, Limacon linkage and the Strandbeest \citep{jansen2009strandbeest}, have low Cayley complexity.

}
\label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure*}



%(2) Given a specific realization type, there is a linear time algorithm to convert 
%from a Cayley configuration $l_f$ to a corresponding realization.
%As we will see in Section \ref{sec:examples}, 
%lots of existing mechanisms can be converted to 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages with low Cayley complexity.
In \citeN{Sitharam2011a}, %we answer the following questions:  
algorithms are given for obtaining an (oriented) Cayley configuration space 
for generic 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages. 
Here a \emph{generic linkage} means that no bar length is zero, all bars have distinct lengths and 
at most one pair of adjacent bars can be collinear in any realization. 
A realization of a generic linkage automatically satisfies the usual notion of genericity in the rigidity literature.
It is also shown that for generic 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages with low Cayley complexity, 
the number of continuous motion paths between two realizations is \emph{at most two}, 
and can be directly obtained from the oriented Cayley configuration spaces with complexity linear
in a natural, discrete measure of the length of the path \cite[Theorem 3]{Sitharam2011a}.
%gave a set of local orientations, such that the Cayley configuration space only has a single interval and can be computed in $O(|V|^2)$ time if and only if this set of local orientations is specified, 

\citeN{Sitharam2011b} gives the following theorem for recognizing low Cayley complexity linkages:
\begin{theorem}[Four-cycle Theorem,  {\cite[Theorem 2]{Sitharam2011b}}]\label{the:four-cycle}
 A 1-dof tree-decomposable linkage has low Cayley complexity
if and only if every construction step of the underlying graph 
is based an adjacent pair of clusters, 
from a \emph{four-cycle} of clusters in the previously constructed graph. 
This yields an algorithm to recognize 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages with low Cayley complexity,
with time complexity quadratic in the number of construction steps of the underlying graph.
\end{theorem}
%
For example, the linkage in Figure \ref{fig:four_cycle}(b) does not have low Cayley complexity, 
since the construction step $v_3 \triangleleft (a,b)$ violates the four-cycle theorem: 
although  $v_3 \triangleleft (a,b)$ is based on the four-cycle of the four clusters $\triangle v_0v_1a$, $(v_1,v_0')$, $\triangle v_0'v_2b$, $(v_0,v_2)$, 
the  base clusters $\triangle v_0v_1a$ and $\triangle v_0'v_2b$ containing $a$ and $b$ are not adjacent in the four-cycle. On the other hand, the linkage in Figure \ref{fig:four_cycle}(b) satisfies the four-cycle theorem and  has low Cayley complexity.


%a recognition algorithm is given for 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages with low Cayley complexity,
%with time complexity quadratic in the number of construction steps of the underlying graph.


While judiciously chosen Cayley parameters  
shed light on many aspects of 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages,  
one persistent problem has been that %multiple Cartesian realizations correspond to the same Cayley configuration.
a non-oriented Cayley interval, being a union of multiple oriented Cayley intervals, 
could correspond to multiple connected components of the realization space. 
%as in Figure \ref{fig:beest_components}. 
%A single non-oriented Cayley interval is a union of multiple oriented Cayley intervals.
%The same example also shows that, 
On the other hand, although an oriented Cayley interval corresponds to a unique connected component, 
the mapping is not bijective, since that same connected component could contain more than one oriented interval \cite[Section 1.2]{sitharam2014beast}.
Figure \ref{fig:diagram} summarizes the different cases when 
determining existence of a continuous motion path between two realizations. 
There are two cases (2 and 3) where there may or may not exist a continuous motion path (a and b).
Previous software  
mentioned in Section \ref{sec:soa}, except for CUIK, 
generate continuous motion within a specified Cayley interval, 
or multiple segments of continuous motion, 
each corresponding to a different oriented Cayley interval with the same realization type. 
%, only looking at the Cayley intervals and realization types, 
Thus they cannot consistently distinguish Case 2a from Case 2b, %as shown in Figure xxx
or Case 3a from Case 3b. %as shown in Figure xxx.
The CUIK software deals with general mechanisms and 
provides comprehensive functionalities in continuous motion and connected components generation. %, distinguishing between these four types.
%uses a derivative tracing based algorithm to 
However, the derivative tracing numerical methods used by CUIK %deals with general linkages, 
must necessarily have non-polynomial complexity (unless P $=$ NP), 
%it could have high time complexity 
as opposed to the linear complexity algorithm \cite[Theorem 3]{Sitharam2011a} for linkages of low Cayley complexity.


\citeN{sitharam2014beast,Sitharam2011a} give a bijective representation to represent the realization space, 
by characterizing a \emph{canonical} method of picking a minimal set of non-edges, called a \emph{complete Cayley vector}, such that adding those non-edges as bars results in global rigidity.
The distance vectors on these non-edges (called \emph{complete Cayley distance vectors}) for each realization of the realization space form a \emph{canonical Cayley curve}, which bijectively represents the realization space.
In addition, the \emph{Cayley distance} between two Cartesian realizations is defined to be the Euclidean distance between their complete Cayley distance vectors,
and the \emph{Cayley distance} between two connected components is defined to be the minimum Cayley distance taken over all pair of realizations, one from each component. 
%which in turn provides a measure of distance between two connected components.
%a simple characterization is given for 1-dof tree-decomposable graphs with low Cayley complexity,
%yielding an efficient recognition algorithm. 

%show that (graph) planarity is equivalent to low Cayley complexity for a natural subclass of 1-dof tree-decomposable graphs. 




%Previous implementations only generate continuous motion for a fixed connected component, 
%or generate all realizations for a fixed realization type and a single user specified interval of the Cayley configuration space. 
%Thus, %we can see from Table \ref{table:cases} that 
%they 


%Based on these existing theoretical  contributions of \cite{Sitharam2011a,Sitharam2011b,sitharam2014beast}, 
In this paper, 
we present \texttt{CayMos}, a new system implementing these existing theoretical results
for configuration spaces analysis of 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages with low Cayley complexity.
%
Practical uses of \texttt{CayMos} include the following. 
(1) A substantial class of under-constrained systems occurring in mechanical CAD %TODO example 
 can be completed appropriately into
well-constrained systems, by providing the user with a comprehensive set of values (the Cayley configuration space) for additional constraints, that guarantee the existence of a solution for the augmented system. 
%
(2) A large class of 3D kinematic mechanisms are ``parallel'' 2D mechanisms based on common linkages 
such as the Strandbeest~\cite{jansen2009strandbeest}.
These mechanisms are used in robotics, self-deploying structures etc.
\texttt{CayMos} provides efficient and comprehensive analysis of their motions: connected components and continuous motion paths. 

In Section \ref{sec:contributions}, 
we list in detail the contributions of this paper in the form of \texttt{CayMos} functionalities.

%\section{\texttt{CayMos} software architecture and pseudocode}
%\label{sec:architecture}

\section{Algorithms implemented in CayMos}
\label{sec:algorithms}

%(existed; clear, brief simple description. can briefly mention QIM. General technique. quick complexity analysis. )
Several algorithms from our previous papers \citeN{Sitharam2011a,Sitharam2011b,sitharam2014beast} are implemented in \texttt{CayMos}. 
Here we give a brief description of these algorithms. 



\textbf{Four-cycle algorithm}: to determine whether a given 1-dof tree-decomposable linkage has low Cayley complexity, 
we implement the \emph{Four-cycle algorithm} \cite[Theorem 2]{Sitharam2011b},
which follows the construction of the linkage, and tests whether each construction step 
satisfies the condition given by the Four-cycle Theorem (see  Section \ref{sec:previous_cayley}).
%is based on 
%an adjacent pair from a \emph{four-cycle} of clusters in the previously constructed graph. 
For each of the $O(|V|)$ construction steps, we need to check $O(|V|)$ candidate base pairs of clusters, so
the overall time complexity is $O(|V|^2)$, 
%\noindent (1) Add all adjacent cluster pairs in the first level to $L$. 
%\noindent (2) For each subsequent construction step $v_{k}\triangleleft(u_{k}\in T_k,w_{k}\in T_k')$, do:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Find the following two sets of clusters: $U=\{T_{u}|T_{u}\in G_{f}(k-1),u_{k}\in T_{u}\}$,
%$W=\{T_{w}|T_{w}\in G_{f}(k-1),w_{k}\in T_{w}\}$.
%\item Find all the pairs $(T_{u},T_{w})\in U\times W$ such that %$T_{u}\cap T_{w}\neq\emptyset$ and 
%$(T_{u},T_{w})$ is in $L$; if no such pair exists, return that $G$ does not have low Cayley complexity. 
%\item For all the pairs $(T_{u},T_{w})\in U\times W$ such that $T_{u}\cap T_{w}\neq\emptyset$,
%add $(T_k,T_{u})$ and $(T_k',T_{w})$ to $L$. Add $(T_k,T_k')$ to $L$.
%\end{enumerate}
%Let $n$ be the total number of construction steps. 
%Step (1) takes $O(n^2)$ time. 
%For each iteration of Step (2), Substep 1 takes $O(d_u+d_k)$ time, Substep 2 takes $O(d_ud_k)$
%time, step 3 takes $O(d_ud_k)$ time, where $d_u = cdeg(u_k)$, $d_w = cdeg(w_k)$. % is the $cdeg$ of $u_k$ and $w_k$. 
%Therefore the overall time complexity is $O(n^2)$. 

\textbf{ELR algorithm}: 
to find the Cayley configuration space of a 1-dof tree-decomposable linkage with low Cayley complexity, 
we implement the \emph{ELR (extreme linkage realization) algorithm} \cite[Section B]{Sitharam2011a}.
The algorithm works by realizing all the \emph{extreme linkages} consistent with each realization type, 
and finding the intersection of all the candidate intervals of the base non-edge. 
%Realizing each extreme linkage takes time $O(n)$. 
The overall time complexity is exponential in $|V|$.
As the problem of computing the Cayley configuration space is NP-hard \citep[Observation 2]{Sitharam2011a},
an improvement over exponential time complexity is unexpected unless P $=$ NP. 
\citeN{Sitharam2011a} also contains another algorithm called \emph{QIM (quadrilateral interval mapping)}, which also computes the Cayley configuration space, 
but only applies to a special subclass of linkages called \emph{1-path} 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages. 
The implementation of QIM algorithm is not included in \texttt{CayMos}. 


\textbf{Continuous motion algorithm}: 
to find continuous motion paths and connected component(s) of the realization space, we implement the \emph{Continuous motion  algorithm} \cite[Theorem 3]{Sitharam2011a}, \cite[Theorem 5(i)]{sitharam2014beast}.
The algorithm works by traversing the intervals in the oriented Cayley configuration space via the common interval endpoints. 
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:previous_cayley},
the time complexity is linear in the number of oriented Cayley configuration space endpoints along the continuous motion path or connected component. 

%For (i), the following algorithm finds a path of continuous motion between two realizations in time linear in the number of endpoints along that path: 
%From the starting realization $G(p_s)$ with forward realization type $\sigma$, 
%we take the oriented Cayley configuration space for realization type $\sigma$ and find the interval $I_\sigma$ that $G(p_s)$ is in. 
%By Lemma \ref{lem:endpoint} (i), inside $I_\sigma$ there always exists a path of continuous motion. 
%Take one endpoint $l_f = l_0$ of $I_\sigma$. 
%In the corresponding realization $G(p_0)$, exactly one entry, say entry $i$, of the forward realization type is $0$. 
%By Lemma \ref{lem:reachable}, 
%the next immediately reachable oriented Cayley configuration space is uniquely determined, 
%since its realization type $\tau$ should be the same as $\sigma$ except having the opposite sign in entry $i$.
%Since intervals in an oriented Cayley configuration space are all disjoint, 
%there is at most one interval in the oriented Cayley configuration space for realization type $\tau$ 
%with $l_0$ as an endpoint. So 
% we can find at most one interval $I_\tau$ immediately reachable. 
%We repeat the process from the other endpoint of $I_\tau$ until we reach the interval containing the target realization, or we may arrive at a deadend, in that case we start again from the other endpoint of $I_\sigma$.  
%Each endpoint encountered leads to at most one next immediately reachable interval, so backtracking is never necessary.
%Therefore the time complexity is linear in the number of endpoints along the path we found.
%Since both endpoints of $I_\sigma$ could potentially lead to the target realization, 
%there are \emph{at most two paths} between two given realizations. 


\textbf{Closest pair algorithm}: 
to find the pair of ``closest'' realizations between two different connected components, 
we implement the \emph{Closest pair algorithm} \cite[Theorem 5(ii)]{sitharam2014beast},
%We use the Continuous motion algorithm to find the oriented Cayley configuration space intervals of both two connected component, 
which samples both components and returns the pair of realizations with the smallest Cayley distance, %from each component. 
which is computed using the complete Cayley distance vector (see Section \ref{sec:previous_cayley}).

The backend of CayMos consistes of two parts:
     a) 1-dof tree decomposable linkages and Cayley
        configuration spaces, and
     b) continuous motion generation and representation.
    The major classes and methods within each of these areas
    are described in further detail in the user manual that
    accompanies the software component~\cite{userman}.

%%Initializes the \textsf{completeCayleyVector} field, % for linkages with low Cayley complexity,

%The method implements the Four-cycle algorithm \cite[Theorem 2]{Sitharam2011b} sketched in Section \ref{sec:algorithms} to determine low Cayley complexity,
%returning \textsf{true} if the calling \textsf{TDLinkage} instance has low Cayley complexity, or \textsf{false} otherwise.
%It also implements  \cite[Theorem 3]{sitharam2014beast} to find the complete Cayley vector

%%Pseudocode for \textsf{findNearestRealizations()}:
%%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%static Pair findNearestRealizations(ContinuousMotion c1, ContinuousMotion c2) {
%%	double nearestDistance = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
%%	Realization result1 = null, result2 = null;
%%	for (Realization r1 : c1.getRealizations()) {
%%		for (Realization r2 : c2.getRealizations()) {
%%			double dis = r1.cayleyDistance(r2);
%%			if (dis < nearestDistance) {
%%				result1 = r1; result2 = r2;
%%				nearestDistance = dis;
%%			}
%%		}
%%	}
%%	return (result1, result2);
%%}
