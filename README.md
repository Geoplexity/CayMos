### CayMos ###

For a common class of 2D mechanisms called 1-dof tree decomposable linkages, CayMos implements efficient algorithmic solutions for: (a) meaningfully representing and visualizing the connected components in the Euclidean realization space; (b) finding a path of continuous motion between two realizations in the same connected component, with or without restricting the realization type (sometimes called orientation type); (c) finding two 'closest' realizations in different connected components.
